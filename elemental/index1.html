        Since very early in the rollout of the Covid vaccines, rumors and
        worries about the vaccines affecting fertility have circulated. Like
        many of the questions people have had about Covid vaccines, this concern
        is a familiar one in the history of vaccines and vaccine hesitancy.
        Misinformation about vaccines and fertility has existed as long as
        vaccines themselves have, and concerns have periodically flared up over
        the years about specific vaccines, from the
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18382140/">smallpox</a>and HPV
        vaccines in the U.S. to the pertussis vaccine in Kenya. In fact, worries
        about vaccines causing infertility are such a common trope that they
        were featured in a fictional plot in an Amazon Prime Video TV show.
